"""Levenshtein and Hamming edit distances for strings.

The distance between two strings is conceptually the number of places that one
or the other string needs to be changed to turn it into the other, much like
those word games where you have to turn "BROWN" into "ORANGE" one letter at a
time.

(BROWN -> BRAWN -> BRAN -> GRAN -> RANG -> RANGE -> ORANGE)

The Hamming distance is a very simple measure of string distance. It simply
counts how many characters are different between the two strings, which must be
of equal length.

The Levenshtein distance (otherwise known as simply "edit distance") is a more
sophisticated measure of string difference. It measures the similarity between
two strings. The distance is the number of deletions, insertions, or
substitutions required to transform one string into the other. The greater the
Levenshtein distance, the more different the strings are.

See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm
http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/Strings.shtml

To be a measure of distance in a metric space, the measurement must be
symmetrical -- that is, distance(string1, string2) must equal distance(string2,
string1). This is true for both Hamming and Levenshtein.

(Not all spaces are metric spaces. For instance, in a city with one-way
streets, it is not always true that distance-as-the-car-drives between points A
and B is the same in both directions.)
